# Glucose Impact Analyzer

An educational web application that estimates the glucose impact of meals and visualizes a predicted short-term glucose response using an explainable AI model.

This project is designed for learning, experimentation, and personal insight. It is not a medical device and does not provide medical advice.

## Overview

Glucose Impact Analyzer AI helps users understand how different meals may affect blood glucose levels by analyzing macronutrients and simple contextual factors.

Users input meal information and receive:

- A glucose impact score from 0 to 100  
- An estimated peak glucose rise  
- A 2-hour predicted glucose curve  
- A clear explanation of how the estimate was calculated  

The system is intentionally transparent and modular so the prediction model can be improved over time.

## Features

- Meal macronutrient input (carbs, fiber, protein, fat)
